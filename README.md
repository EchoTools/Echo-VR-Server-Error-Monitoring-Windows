> [!WARNING]
> When using Tiny10/Tiny11, some auto-install stuff may break.
> <br>You may need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31312/) (for setup) and/or [PowerShell 7](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/install-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.5#msi) (for the monitor) manually.

## Setting up a new server? 
Download EchoVR-Server-Setup.py from the code tab, [compile it](https://github.com/EchoTools/EchoVR-Windows-Hosts-Resources/wiki/Setup-Guide#compiling-the-setup-program), and run it for a streamlined setup experience. <br>(binary release coming soon<sup>tm</sup>)

> [!TIP]
> Ensure you've installed Echo with [Mia's Installer](https://github.com/marshmallow-mia/Echo-VR-Installer/releases) before starting.

Otherwise, follow the [setup guide](https://github.com/EchoTools/EchoVR-Windows-Hosts-Resources/wiki/Setup-Guide#windows-server-host-setup) to get the same result.

## Just need the server monitor?
Download the latest server monitor from [releases](https://github.com/EchoTools/EchoVR-Windows-Hosts-Resources/releases).
<br>Give the [usage guide](https://github.com/EchoTools/EchoVR-Windows-Hosts-Resources/wiki/Usage-Guide#server-monitor-usage) a quick skim before starting.
